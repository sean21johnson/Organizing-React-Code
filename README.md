NOTEFUL APP

Create notes and save them in specific folders!

In this application, our user has the ability to:

    -View all of their notes that are stored in a local API
    -Filter notes based on the folder they belong to
    -Add a new folder
    -Add a new note with a name, folder, and description
    -Delete a note at any time
    -View error boundary displaying rendering errors
    -View errors during the API fetch request process

I utilized the below in creating this React application:

    -Create-React-App
    -Controlled forms
    -Error Boundaries
    -PropTypes
    -BrowserRouter Component
    -Context
